# SHF Smart Home Simulation System

## Introduction
Welcome to the **SHF Smart Home Simulation System**, an interactive program that simulates a smart home environment. This system allows users to manage and control smart devices such as lights and thermostats in a virtual home. The system showcases Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation, to provide a modular and scalable solution.

## Installation
To run the SHF Smart Home Simulation System, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio).
2. Copy the source code into a file named `SmartHome.cpp`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the file.
4. Compile the program using the following command:

   ```bash
   g++ -o SmartHome SmartHome.cpp
   ```

5. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   ./SmartHome
   ```

## Usage

### Features:
1. **Add Devices**: Add smart devices to your home, such as lights and thermostats.
2. **Control Devices**: Turn devices on or off, adjust brightness for lights, and set temperatures for thermostats.
3. **Display Device Status**: View the current status of all devices in the home.

### Steps to Use:
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the smart home PIN (`0909`) to access the system.
3. Use the menu options to interact with the system:
   - Add devices by specifying their type and ID.
   - Control devices by selecting them and performing actions like turning them on/off or adjusting their settings.
   - Display the status of all devices.
4. Exit the program when done.
